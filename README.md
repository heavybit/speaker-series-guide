# The Best Speakers Offer
* A Strong POV: You believe there is a right way to build developer companies and communities. Offer that opinion and use specific early-stage examples from developer and SaaS companies to persuade us. 
* Tactical Advice: Offer tips, metrics, best practices, tools and resources. We want to implement your advice this week. What can our teams implement today that isn’t already well-known? 
* Personal Stories: Forget sweeping generalizations and abstract concepts. Where possible, we want to hear about your real failures and successes. Get personal and give us insider knowledge about a major company or project. Slides with examples of specific strategy docs, user flow models, and real campaigns are super useful. 
* A Tailored and Well-Structured Presentation: Offer a logical progression and framework, peppered with examples related to developer companies and products. Talks often include an intro, a problem statement or POV, supporting examples/points, and a take away/conclusion slide. 

## More 
* Panelists & Fireside:  Typically it’s the job of the moderator to provide you with questions ahead of your talk. We’ll also leave about 30 min for audience questions and end on a final question from the moderator -- namely, what final tips do you you have for those in the room?
* Presenters:  You’ll use your laptop to present a Keynote or Powerpoint presentation to onsite attendees in an aspect ratio of 4:3. We ask that you send slides ahead of the event as we embed this version in our video player. Onsite we’ve got dongles for a variety of machines, but if you need the use of one of our machines we can provide that as well. 


# Disclosures
Advisors and writers sometimes contribute because they are considering new job opportunities, are curious about formal board advisor roles, or are building new consulting businesses. We require that you disclose any potential conflicts or potential material gain before posting or engaging in an advisory relationship with our members.
